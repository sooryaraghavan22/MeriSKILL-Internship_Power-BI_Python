Sales Data Analysis 
PURPOSE: 
Analyse sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business 
decision-making. 
DESCRIPTION: 
In this project, we will dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. I will 
explore sales trends over time, identify the best-selling products, calculate revenue metrics 
such as total sales and profit margins, and create visualizations to present your findings 
effectively. This project showcases your ability to manipulate and derive insights from large 
datasets, enabling me to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales 
strategies.
